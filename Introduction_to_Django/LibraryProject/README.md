Here’s a suggested content for your `README.md` file describing the steps you've accomplished for the Django project setup and organization:

---

# LibraryProject

## Project Overview
The **LibraryProject** is a foundational Django project created as part of the ALX Python learning journey. This project introduces the workflow of Django, including project creation, running a development server, and managing files.

## Setup and Steps

### 1. **Django Installation**
Ensure Python is installed on your system and Django installed using:
```bash
pip install django
```

---

### 2. **Creating the Django Project**
The Django project was initialized using:
```bash
django-admin startproject LibraryProject
```

---

### 3. **Running the Development Server**
To start the server, navigate to the project directory and run:
```bash
cd LibraryProject
python manage.py runserver
```

Initially, port 8000 was unavailable, but an alternative solution was implemented:
- Checking port usage (`netstat -tuln | grep :8000`) confirmed port conflict.
- Moved to another port:
  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver 8080
  ```

---

### 4. **Project Structure**
The following key components were explored:
- `settings.py`: Central configuration for the Django project.
- `urls.py`: URL routing for the project.
- `manage.py`: A command-line utility for interacting with the Django project.

---

### 5. **GitHub Repository**
The project resides in the repository: **Alx_DjangoLearnLab**. The directory structure is organized as follows:
```
Introduction_to_Django/
├── Alx_DjangoLearnLab/
│   └── LibraryProject/
│       ├── README.md
│       ├── manage.py
│       ├── settings.py
│       ├── urls.py
│       ├── ...
```

**Note:** The `Alx_DjangoLearnLab` folder was moved out of `Introduction_to_Django` for better organization:
```bash
mv Introduction_to_Django/Alx_DjangoLearnLab .
```
